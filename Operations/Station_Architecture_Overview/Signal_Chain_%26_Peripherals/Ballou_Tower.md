This page will detail routing and equipment information from the WMFO
equipment in Ballou. Signal chain will read roughly down the page, with
some exceptions.

### PDU 

This device is a network accessible power distributor, which runs off of
a dedicated fibox line and will soon run out of the UPS. This allows you
to remotely power cycle many devices in the tower for troubleshooting
purposes. Obviously the prime candidate here is the Omnia which has
shown some flakiness. You shouldn't need to use it, but it's here as a
hard kill switch. Outlets are labeled in software.

### Router Selector 

Currently also sends the output of the Inovonics Model 531 modulation
meter back down as RF-TOW-MON livewire source. This will give garbage
audio if the transmitter powers down, and can serve as a substitute for
the Belar if need arises.

Allows you to listen to various sources over headphones which is good.

### Omnia FM 

Input: Livewire EAS Output

Output: AES audio (primary) and Livewire (secondary)

Also has other I/O and failover support.

Basically just slams our normalized audio up to maximum volume and adds
compression. Then theÂ 

#### Functionality: 

1.  This terminates the livewire network (listens to the EAS output)
2.  applies configurable multi-band compression
3.  Applies 75 uS pre-emphasis (US FM Standard EQ thing)
4.  Outputs AES audio (turned down a few dB from max to lower
    modulation)

#### MPX Signal Lesson: 

MPX stands for multiplex and includes

-   FM L+R sum 0-15 khz
-   19k Pilot Tone (tells stereo decoders "yes this is a stereo FM
    broadcast")
-   FM L-R difference signal (Double Sideband Supressed Carrier)
-   (not yet, but someday) RDS at 57 kHz (3x harmonic of 19k pilot tone)

which is modulated onto the 91.5 mHz carrier in the Heterodyne
Modulator. This signal should be thought of as a sound based signal even
though the stereo is encoded at frequencies higher than humans can hear.
The amplitude of this signal translates into carrier deviation inside
the modulator where carier deviation is proportional to amplitude of MPX
signal. Calibration is key.

### Inovonics RDS Encoder 

We have an IP enabled Inovonics RDS encoder. It is configured over IP
Telnet (and a Windows utility installed on Smooth).

1.  Data pushed to spinitron by user or Rivendell
2.  Spinitron pushes data to Duke
3.  Script on Duke generates a string
4.  String pushed to RDS encoder
5.  RDS encoder receives MPX output from Mozart
6.  RDS encoder generates 57 KHz RDS output
7.  RDS input to Mozart
8.  Mozart adds RDS to transmitted signal

### DB Broadcast Mozart 100 Transmitter 

Gets AES signal from Omnia. Generates stereo signal. Adds RDS either
from internal RDS encoder or external. Provides control interface,
monitoring, email alerts.

Outputs Modulated and amplified FM signal at 91.5 MHz and \~53 watts.

Watt Meter should confirm this. It should be calibrated with the VRC2500
to read 100% at 54 watts. There's a little fluctuation in output wattage
especially right after you turn it on and this is probably acceptable.
It's not like the FCC is going to come barging in the door unless we're
up 10% above our specified level or more. Best not to tempt fate though.

Terminates this into our antenna which is a 50 ohm load. VSWR is the
ratio of forward to reflected power. 1:1 is happy, 1:infinity is death.
Should kick itself off if the VSWR gets too high (would be caused by
antenna being destroyed).

### Rereceive/Modulation Meter 

This is an Inovonics Model 531 FM modulation monitor
([manual](http://www.inovonicsbroadcast.com/wp-content/uploads/catablog/downloads/531Manual.pdf "http://www.inovonicsbroadcast.com/wp-content/uploads/catablog/downloads/531Manual.pdf")).
Shows up on RF-TOW-MON channel. Can also give you a real time modulation
indication.

To calibrate modulation:

1.  Adjust the Composite 1 output voltage on the Omnia Remote Control
    Java Applet until the modulation hovers around 100%. The peak light
    may light, but only ocasionally (less than 10 times/minute is
    acceptable). There is probably some room above this for more
    modulation (see notes below).
2.  Switch to pilot tone measurement and adjust the 19 kHz pilot tone
    injection level until it reads about 9% on that meter. If you had to
    increase this measurement, best check that the overall increase in
    modulation hasn't significantly altered the readings.
3.  Switch back to regular modulation metering and make sure everything
    still looks good.

#### Notes on Modulation Measurements: 

The manual specifies the integration time of the modulation calculator
is by default set to 100 microseconds, and can be adjusted with an
internal modulator up to 1 millisecond. Increasing the integration time
has the effect of lowering the overall modulation reading for given
content by averaging more readings together. The manual (also an
excellent resource on calibrating FM transmitters) says that 1 ms is
generally safe most all of the time. The safest bet here is to use a
separate antenna to compare our off-air signal with that of local
commercial stations and set our modulation to tend to be a little lower
than theirs.
