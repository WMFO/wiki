WMFO has a standard IP network. The primary components are the central switches and the router.

We have three switches

1.  48 port Cisco switch with 4 SFP slots in Control
2.  8 port Cisco with 1 SFP slot in the Tower
3.  8 port Trendnet PoE switch for Access Points and PoE peripherals in Control

The Cisco switches are bridged by a run of Single Mode fiber between Curtis and Ballou to provide full gigabit. In addition, there are currently two 100mbps media converters that run individual devices in Ballou (the PDU is run separately to allow hard rebooting the switch without losing ability to control the PDU).
