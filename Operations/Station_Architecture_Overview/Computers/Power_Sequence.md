Before Beginning: Wiki will not be accessible after shutdown of Smooth. For your convenience, we recommend you print out this page and the credential page.

You may also want to take this opportunity to run updates on all linux machines as this gives you a chance to get new kernels installed before the reboot. Samba may also be updated which normally kills Rivendell audio.

Full Power Down Sequence:

1.  Grab a flashlight (optional)
2.  Transmitter - power off through web portal; use Smooth.
3.  All terminals (Adele, Coulton, Floodland (MD), Devolution (B, usually off))
4.  All terminal UPS systems (press/hold central power button)
5.  Duke Shutdown
6.  Smooth (may take a while due to Windows AutoUpdate **THIS COULD TAKE OVER 30 MINUTES** if it's been a while)
7.  Annex UPSs
8.  Super
9.  Control Room UPSs (floor UPS feeds Studio A, then rack mounted CONUPS1)
10. Control Room Furmans (both top and bottom on rack)
11. Power down CD Players in SA and SC
12. Unplug SC plugs from wall
13. All other power strips and things (walk around and look for lights)
14. Studio A, Studio Dee, Annex, Vinyl and Control AC units off
15. Lock Doors to SA and SC (in addition to Tech 1, Control, Annex)

 

Note: Access card systems can take 45 minutes to come online; take that into account during scheduling the outage.

This power up order should make sure LiveWire & Rivendell come up without hassle:

1.  Annex: Smooth UPS, Nick UPS, boot both
2.  Control Furmans
3.  Control UPSes (top and bottom on rack, floor unit for Bay B/SA)
4.  Make sure control machines are booting
5.  Return to Studio A, wait for element and computer to boot
6.  Once all systems are go on Element, check to ensure you can play music over the monitors.
7.  If right four element channels aren't online or the element is being wonky, refer to the [troubleshooting page](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Station_Architecture_Overview/IP_Network/Livewire/Fixing_the_Board "Fixing the Board").
8.  If Studio A can broadcast and the internet is working, power transmitter on and record time. If Studio A does not come up, consider broadcasting from C.
9.  Studio C: replug, UPS, computer
10. Studio B and MD UPSs
11. Any lingering power strips.

 

The entire shutdown sequence takes around ~~20~~ minutes (45 if the Windows machine updates take forever). Start 1 hour before outage and don't have people planning on DJing until  :45-1 hour after. You may wish to fetch a hard copy of important wiki pages because the wiki will be down. You may want to grab a flashlight from tech. Expect not to get into any card access door while the power is out, as the card reader battery backup dies quickly. Log that we're off-air to Spinitron and the [station log](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Regulatory/Station_Log "Station Log") afterwards. Best practice is to lock Studios A and C while they are offline (the "technologically confident" DJs will begin to throw switches haphazardly).
