WMFO Wiki => Github
===================

Tragically, mindTouch stopped supporting the wiki software upon which the old WMFO wiki was based. All of the data from the original site was painstakingly dumped and converted to markdown and preserved here. All the old attachments are available [here](http://wiki-files.wmfo.org) and we have added links to the bottom of pages which had them previously. All images should also be embedded on the respective pages.

For the time being, you can access the old site [here](https://legacy-wiki.wmfo.org) but it's going to fade in and out and will eventually be retired as we have no way of ensuring security of the site.

This version of the site is (quite) rough around the edges right now; bear with us while we clean it up. Important data will be migrated to the main WMFO site over the next few weeks.

Please shoot a message to ops at wmfo.org with any questions.
