I'm leaving Nick Andre's bio because I enjoy the picture of him above. I
may update this soon. I know you're all so excited and probably not
reading this so you won't even realize that this quickly transitions
into Nick's bio. In all honesty though, he is a great resource as I am
still learning the ropes of the station. Email all your woes to him at
[nick@wmfo.org](mailto:nick@wmfo.org "mailto:nick@wmfo.org").

I'm Nick, a computer engineering nerd who loves computers and radios.
The picture is me working the boards at WIQH in Concord in 2003 (taken
by my grandmother). Some things never change.

Shortly after this picture was taken everyone in the other studio began
insisting that I answer the phone (flashers look similar to flashes
apparently).
