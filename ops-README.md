This page is designed to facilitate the ops learning process. There's a lot of information to know, most of which is not covered in any Tufts course. However, knowing how this station operates will give you a lot of practical, real world experience in:

1.  Network administration and Networking
2.  Linux System Administration
3.  Axia/Livewire configuration
4.  Hackery

The Ops Director or any former operations directors are great starting points if you have trouble finding information, but you can find most of what there is to know within this Wiki.

This section details tables and explanations related to the ops department. Some of this content is accessible only by logging in with an account of the appropriate credential level. The best way to get information is to contact the ops list, [wmfo-ops@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-ops@googlegroups.com "wmfo-ops@googlegroups.com") and be trained by existing ops volunteers.


The [Rivendell](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Rivendell "Rivendell") page provides a good overview of the [signal chain](https://docs.google.com/a/wmfo.org/drawings/d/1ZioPk_CP5EZg8U6Jix9IY1ol_1xH6u0A_kD7RZt3h1g/edit "https://docs.google.com/a/wmfo.org/drawings/d/1ZioPk_CP5EZg8U6Jix9IY1ol_1xH6u0A_kD7RZt3h1g/edit"). [LiveWire](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Axia_and_Telos "Axia and Telos") is the protocol that routes audio through the station, and is used by all Axia equipment (and their parent company, Telos). You can get a sense of the network from the [I](https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Operations/Diagrams_%26_Tables/IP_Address_Space "IP Address Space")[P table](https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Operations/Diagrams_%26_Tables/IP_Address_Space "IP Address Space") and and get details from the [normal tables](https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Operations/Diagrams_%26_Tables/Axia_Normal_Tables "Axia Normal Tables"). Most of our code is or will/should be on [Github](https://github.com/organizations/WMFO "https://github.com/organizations/WMFO"). And sometimes you just need to [fix the board](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Axia_and_Telos/Fixing_the_Board "Fixing the Board").
