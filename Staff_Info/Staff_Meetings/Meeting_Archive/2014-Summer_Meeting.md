The summer 2014 staff meeting occurred on Sunday, April 27, 2014 from 7 to 8 p.m. in Pearson 104.

Please review the presentations posted below if you were unable to attend.

The graffiti policy has been updated to disallow vulgar content. A window air conditioner will be placed in Studio A during the summer. Attempting to remove the AC unit will result in automatic suspension. Our goal is to keep the AC from falling out of the window.
