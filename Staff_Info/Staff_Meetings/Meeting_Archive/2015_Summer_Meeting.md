The summer 2015 staff meeting took place on Sunday, April 26, 2015 at 7 pm in Pearson 104.

Here is a summary of the meeting that outgoing General Manager Parker MacLure emailed to the staff that evening:

Important Info:

Now that we have had our last meeting of the year the new executive board is officially starting their terms!! We're very excited to welcome everyone to the board and transition into the 2015-2016 year! 

 

Thank you all for being an amazing group of people. I really love WMFO and it has been an honor to serve as your General Manager. I don't know where I will be next year, but if I am in the Boston area I hope to continue being involved as a community member! I'll be at the volunteer day next week if you want to come say hi. Long live freeform community radio!!!! \<3  

 

Peace,

Parker
